# Electron Publishing: Fix for Missing @mcp_router/remote-api-types During GitHub Actions Release

Context
- GitHub Actions release for the Electron app failed with TS2307: Cannot find module '@mcp_router/remote-api-types'.
- Webpack/ts-loader excludes node_modules and the package '@mcp_router/remote-api-types' expects prebuilt dist/*.d.ts and dist/*.js files, which are not guaranteed to exist during the publish step when running only the Electron publish script.
- A warning also appeared: "The field \"pnpm\" was found in apps/electron/package.json. This will not take effect. You should configure \"pnpm\" at the root of the workspace instead."

Root Cause
- The Electron build used ts-loader with `exclude: /node_modules/`, so `@mcp_router/remote-api-types` (linked into node_modules via pnpm workspaces) was not compiled from its TypeScript source when dist/ was missing.
- TypeScript resolution tried to read `types` from the package which pointed to `dist/index.d.ts` (not present), causing TS2307.
- pnpm overrides were defined inside apps/electron/package.json instead of the workspace root, which pnpm ignores for workspace-wide resolution.

Changes Implemented
1) TypeScript path aliasing for @mcp_router/remote-api-types
- apps/electron/tsconfig.json now includes:
  - "@mcp_router/remote-api-types": ["../../packages/remote-api-types/src"]
  - "@mcp_router/remote-api-types/*": ["../../packages/remote-api-types/src/*"]
- These mappings improve TypeScript tooling and editor support across the monorepo.
- Also added a project reference to packages/remote-api-types for clarity.
- Root tsconfig.json was updated with matching paths and a reference to packages/remote-api-types to improve repo-wide type tooling coherence.

2) Move pnpm overrides to the root workspace
- Removed the "pnpm" field from apps/electron/package.json.
- Merged its overrides into the root package.json under "pnpm.overrides":
  - tmp@<=0.2.3 -> >=0.2.4
  - electron@>=36.0.0-alpha.1 <36.8.1 -> >=36.8.1
  - (jsondiffpatch@<0.7.2 -> >=0.7.2 already existed at root)
- This removes the pnpm warning and ensures consistent dependency resolution in CI.

3) Webpack aliasing to source for @mcp_router/remote-api-types
- apps/electron/webpack.renderer.config.ts and apps/electron/webpack.main.config.ts now include resolve.alias entries:
  - "@mcp_router/remote-api-types" -> ../../packages/remote-api-types/src
  - "@mcp_router/remote-api-types/schema" -> ../../packages/remote-api-types/src/schema
- This ensures the Electron bundler (ts-loader + webpack) resolves and transpiles the package directly from source (outside node_modules), even when dist/ has not been built for the package.
- With this change, the publish/make steps no longer require a prior build of packages/remote-api-types.

Operational Notes
- With the path alias in place, the Electron webpack build can consume @mcp_router/remote-api-types without requiring a prior build of that package.
- If you choose to build packages ahead of time (e.g., turbo run build), that continues to work and is compatible with this change.

Suggested Commands for Local Maintenance
- pnpm typecheck
- pnpm knip
- pnpm lint:fix (results can be noisy, errors can be ignored for now)

Impact
- Fixes GitHub Actions release failure due to missing remote-api-types during Electron bundling.
- Eliminates pnpm overrides warning by consolidating configuration at the workspace root.
